## Code Validation

### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

| File | CI URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| run.py | [PEP8 CI](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RoBizMan/penalty-shootout-game/main/run.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/pythonvalidation.png) | All clear, no errors found |

## Browser Compatibility

I have tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Browser | Home | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | ![screenshot](documentation/chrome.png) | Works as expected |
| Firefox | ![screenshot](documentation/firefox.png) | Works as expected |
| Edge | ![screenshot](documentation/edge.png) | Works as expected |

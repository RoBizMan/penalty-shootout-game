## Code Validation

### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

| File | CI URL | Screenshot | Notes |

| run.py | [PEP8 CI](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RoBizMan/penalty-shootout-game/main/run.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/pythonvalidation.png) | All clear, no errors found |

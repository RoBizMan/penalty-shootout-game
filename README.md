The primary focus of the target audience is football enthusiasts, gamers, and anyone intrigued by interactive command-line games. Whether you are a seasoned football fan wanting to simulate the thrill of a penalty shoot-out, a casual gamer looking for a quick and fun distraction, or a Python learner interested in seeing what the language can do, this game is for you.

#### Value Proposition ⁤

Immerse yourself in penalty shoot-outs from the comfort of your desk. The game goes beyond mere victories or defeats. It is about the path you take and the choices you make. It combines strategy and chance, recreating a real penalty shoot-out's unpredictable nature and high stakes. Each decision you make, whether shooting or guarding the goal, can alter the game. The game is designed to be interactive and enjoyable, regardless of your football knowledge or gaming proficiency.

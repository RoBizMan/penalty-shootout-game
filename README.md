### Introduction

Experience the excitement of a realistic penalty shoot-out game from your terminal with our interactive game. This project aims to design an immersive experience that allows users to engage in a simulated penalty shoot-out, making strategic decisions just like in an actual game. The game was created with Python, highlighting the language’s flexibility and strength. This is part of the third portfolio project of the Code Institute course.

#### Target Audience ⁤

The primary focus of the target audience is football enthusiasts, gamers, and anyone intrigued by interactive command-line games. Whether you are a seasoned football fan wanting to simulate the thrill of a penalty shoot-out, a casual gamer looking for a quick and fun distraction, or a Python learner interested in seeing what the language can do, this game is for you.

#### Value Proposition ⁤

Immerse yourself in penalty shoot-outs from the comfort of your desk. The game goes beyond mere victories or defeats. It is about the path you take and the choices you make. It combines strategy and chance, recreating a real penalty shoot-out's unpredictable nature and high stakes. Each decision you make, whether shooting or guarding the goal, can alter the game. The game is designed to be interactive and enjoyable, regardless of your football knowledge or gaming proficiency.

## UX

In this project, I follow the Five Planes of User Experience model invented by Jesse James Garrett.

### Five Planes of User Experience

This model aids in transforming from abstract ideas, such as creating objectives of the project and identifying the user needs, to concrete concepts, such as assembling visual elements together to produce the visual design of the idea to meet the project's objectives and users' needs.

#### The Strategy Plane

This project centred around creating a captivating command-line game that mimics the experience of a football penalty shootout. This game was designed to entertain players, challenge their decision-making abilities, and showcase Python’s development potential.

#### The Scope Plane

The game was designed to incorporate essential elements of a penalty shootout. The included elements are the coin toss for determining who goes first, choosing the target area, deciding which area to defend, and calculating and displaying scores. The game was created to be replayable, offering unique outcomes in every playthrough.

##### Content requirements:
- Clear and concise guidelines for playing, including shooting and defending.
- The latest game status, including the score and whose turn it is.
- Instant feedback on the result of each turn, like whether a shot was successful or saved.

##### Functionality requirements:
- Players can input their decisions in the game, whether it is selecting a target area for a shot or choosing an area to defend.
- The game must correctly execute the penalty shoot-out rules, with the user and computer opponent taking turns.
- The game should have replayability, allowing users to play again without restarting the program.

#### The Structure Plane

Please refer to the [Data Model](#DataModel) section for more detailed data model.

#### The Skeleton Plane

The game’s interface is text-based. Information is presented to the user in a clear and organised manner. The purpose of user input prompts is to be straightforward and clear. The implementation of error handling helps direct the user to valid inputs.
